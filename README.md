# Lead-in-Blood
This program reads in data containing the lead levels in blood from a CSV file and shows how their changing with respect to time  

The purpose of this project is to showcase the change in lead on blood levels over time and try to determine what factors lead to
such changes occuring. With that information we might be able to make some recommendations on what to do so as to decrease people's
exposures to lead and improve overall health outcomes.


When running the code as shown below we are presented with the following graph which illustrates how levels of lead change over time

I noticed an increase in lead after 2008 which leads me to beleive that the housing crash may have caused levels to rise and that lead
levels might be tied to socioeconomic status. This could be because regions with less resources may find it difficult to replace faulty
or old pipes which may lead to increased exposure. I can use other data sources (such as data relating to the economic situtation of
certain neighborhoods to see if there is some correlation between those 2 factors).... I'm still developing this projects as I continue
to improve my skills in this field
